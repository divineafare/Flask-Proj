# Flask-Proj
#urvey Tool for Collecting Participant Data

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a simple survey tool for collecting participant data related to income and spending habits, aimed at preparing for a new product launch in the healthcare industry. The tool is developed using **Flask** for web application, **MongoDB** for data storage, and **Python** (or **R**) for data processing and analysis. The data is processed, visualized, and exported for use in client presentations. The tool is then deployed on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** for easy access.

## Features

- Flask Web Application: A simple web form for collecting participant data.
- MongoDB Storage: Data (age, gender, income, and expenses) is securely stored in MongoDB.
- Data Processing: Data is processed into a CSV file using Python or R.
- Data Visualization: Generated visualizations include income distribution by age and gender distribution across spending categories.
- Export for PowerPoint: Visualizations can be exported for client presentations.
- AWS Deployment: Flask application hosted on AWS for public access.

  
Key Points:
1. Web Application: Flask is used to build the web interface for collecting data.
2. Data Storage: MongoDB stores participant data, including demographics and spending categories.
3. Data Processing: Python or R is used to process data and generate visualizations.
4. Deployment: The application was  deployed on AWS using Ec2 on http://13.48.136.125:5000/
